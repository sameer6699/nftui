## Introduction

The NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to mint, list, and trade NFTs. NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership of items such as art, music, and collectibles. This project leverages smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent transactions without intermediaries.
## Features

- Minting NFTs: Create new NFTs and store metadata on IPFS.
- Listing NFTs: List NFTs for sale or auction.
- Buying and Selling: Buy NFTs directly or place bids on auctions.
- Wallet Integration: Connect and interact with the marketplace    using Ethereum wallets like MetaMask.
- User Profiles: View and manage user-owned NFTs and transaction history.


## Architecture

The NFT Marketplace consists of the following components:

- Smart Contracts: Implemented in Solidity, these govern the creation, ownership, and transfer of NFTs.
- Frontend: Built with React.js, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the marketplace.
- Backend: Node.js server to handle off-chain operations and interactions with IPFS for metadata storage.
- IPFS: Used for decentralized storage of NFT metadata.

## Installation
